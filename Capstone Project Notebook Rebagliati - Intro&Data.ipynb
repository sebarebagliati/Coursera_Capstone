    "In my capstone project I will try to cross information of venues available in each Neighborhood of the city of Buenos Aires (via Foursquare API) with the Avg Price per square meter on that Neighborhood, in order to identify whether there is a Neighborhood where enough of these venues are missing and Avg Price per square meter is relatively low, so that an opportunity for market penetration is identified.\n",
